## html 标签的一些共有的属性有哪些

class id style

只能想到这些。。。

## html 的新特性

- 语义化标签

seo

盲人

header footer section article nav aside

- type增强

```html
<input type="range" >
```

range color...

- 表单增强

autofocus

required

placehoder

- api

拖拽 存储 ...

## overflow

- visible
- clip
- hidden
- scroll
- auto

BFC   -> Clip -> 图层 -> paint 

理解了paint就知道为啥overflow可能产生BFC了



## flex

- `initial`

The item is sized according to its width and height properties. It shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container, but does not grow to absorb any extra free space in the flex container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 0 1 auto".

- `auto`

The item is sized according to its width and height properties, but grows to absorb any extra free space in the flex container, and shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 1 1 auto".

- `none`

The item is sized according to its width and height properties. It is fully inflexible: it neither shrinks nor grows in relation to the flex container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 0 0 auto".

```css
/* One value, unitless number: flex-grow */
flex: 2;

/* One value, width/height: flex-basis */
flex: 10em;
flex: 30%;
flex: min-content;
```



## 深拷贝

主要说下JSON那一套的问题

`JSON.stringify()` converts a value to JSON notation representing it:

- If the value has a `toJSON()` method, it's responsible to define what data will be serialized.
- [`Boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean), [`Number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number), and [`String`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) objects are converted to the corresponding primitive values during stringification, in accord with the traditional conversion semantics.
- [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined), [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)s, and [`Symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)s are not valid JSON values. If any such values are encountered during conversion they are either omitted (when found in an object) or changed to [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null) (when found in an array). `JSON.stringify()` can return `undefined` when passing in "pure" values like `JSON.stringify(function(){})` or `JSON.stringify(undefined)`.
- All [`Symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)-keyed properties will be completely ignored, even when using the `replacer` function.
- The instances of [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) implement the `toJSON()` function by returning a string (the same as `date.toISOString()`). Thus, they are treated as strings.
- The numbers [`Infinity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity) and [`NaN`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN), as well as the value [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null), are all considered `null`.
- All the other [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) instances (including [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set), [`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap), and [`WeakSet`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet)) will have only their enumerable properties serialized.



## `on` 和 `addEventListener` 的区别

## Array的一些方法

```js
[].concat(1,[2,2,[3]])
// (4) [1, 2, 2, Array(1)]

const numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```



## 序列化
