## Ajax

**Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, while not a technology in itself, is a term coined in 2005 by Jesse James Garrett, that describes a "new" approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or [XHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML), [XSLT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT), and most importantly the [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) object.
When these technologies are combined in the Ajax model, web applications are able to make quick, incremental updates to the user interface without reloading the entire browser page. This makes the application faster and more responsive to user actions.

Although X in Ajax stands for XML, [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON) is used more than XML nowadays because of its many advantages such as being lighter and a part of JavaScript. Both JSON and XML are used for packaging information in the Ajax model.
